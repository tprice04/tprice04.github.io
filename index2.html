      <h2 class="col-title"> Skateboarding</h2>
      <p>I started skateboarding in the summer of 2020. I’ve always wanted to skate but I never got the motivation to commit and actually learn. Because of Covid-19 I was forced to find ways to keep active and I decided it was the perfect opportunity to learn how to skate. It was the best decision I ever made!</p>

      <h2 class="col-title">Fashion Design</h2>
      <p>I love shopping and it has become a bad habit, I still have clothes I haven’t worn and continue to shop whenever I can. So, I wanted to find a way to make myself feel less guilty. I started following and watching fashion channels on youtube, pinning ideas on pinterest. One day, I went to Micheals and bought a bunch of shirts, paint, glitter, pearls, patches etc. and I simply let my mind take me. Above is a picture of two shirts I made. I hope to start my own clothing line in the future. </p>

      <h2 class="col-title">Getting Outside</h2>
      <p>I think getting outside is very important! With technology becoming so heavily accessible the social climate has changed. I love to disconnect from my phone and actually spend time with friends and family. This summer I planned most of the “get togethers”. Above is a picture of my friends and I having a picnic. I think people connect better via in-person communication vs texting, calling etc. I am a strong advocate for getting out and breaking your technology addiction! </p>
